# Recipe Daddy 
*Recipe finder*

⭐️ Purpose 
Ala’addin and I started this project as a way to teach ourselves the react framework from scratch. Although a better version of our website already exists (recipecook) We thought that this would be a good challenge to incorporate using API’s for the first time, working with ChatGPT, user databases and connecting them to the front and using our custom API’s. 

👨🏻‍🏫 About
This website gives you a break on finding the recipe for the night. You upload a photo of your fridge and get a list of recipes that you can make in return. Or alternatively, you can search and pick your ingredients.

🧗🏽‍♂️ Challenges 
Language learning - We only know a little bit about JavaScript and resorted to having AI teach us the best paths forward. 
File formatting - we don’t know what we don’t know. We’re making our best judgements for how to properly nest the components and how to handle the css/react. If you have any better suggestions please open an issue.
